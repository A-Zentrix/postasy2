  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">2. Acceptable use</h5>

    <li>Do not use the Services to violate any law, infringe rights, or transmit harmful content (e.g., malware, illegal, harassing, or hateful material).</li>
    <li>Do not attempt to interfere with or disrupt the Services, bypass security, or misuse APIs.</li>
    <li>AI‑generated outputs may be non‑unique and similar to results for other users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">3. Your content and licenses</h5>
  <ul class="text-muted">
    <li>You retain ownership of content you upload or create, to the extent you have rights in it.</li>
    <li>You grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, reproduce, process, and display your content solely to provide and improve the Services.</li>
    <li>You represent you have the necessary rights to upload and use the content with the Services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">4. Plans, billing, and taxes</h5>

    <li>Paid subscriptions bill in advance and renew automatically until canceled. You may cancel at any time; benefits remain until the end of the billing period.</li>
    <li>Payments are processed by third‑party providers (e.g., Stripe); their terms and privacy policies apply.</li>

  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">5. Intellectual property</h5>

  <h5 class="mt-4">6. Term and termination</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or if necessary to protect the Services or other users. You may stop using the Services at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive (including IP, disclaimers, and limitations of liability).</p>

  <h5 class="mt-4">7. Disclaimers</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-4">8. Limitation of liability</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, POSTASY AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO POSTASY IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-4">9. Indemnity</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Postasy from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Services or violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-4">10. Governing law and disputes</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in your local jurisdiction unless otherwise required by law. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts having jurisdiction over Postasy’s principal place of business, except where applicable law provides otherwise.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-4">11. Changes to Terms</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms and revise the effective date. Material changes may be communicated in‑app or via email. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.</p>
