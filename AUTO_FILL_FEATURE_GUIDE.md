# Auto-Fill White Space Feature Guide - Posterly Editor

## Overview
The poster editor now includes an intelligent auto-fill feature that automatically adds user profile information to empty areas of posters, utilizing the fields that were selected during the poster generation process.

## New Auto-Fill Feature

### 1. Auto-Fill White Space Button
- **Location**: Credit Info panel in the poster editor
- **Access**: Click "Auto-Fill White Space" button
- **Shortcut**: Ctrl+F keyboard shortcut
- **Purpose**: Automatically fills empty areas with user profile information

### 2. Smart Field Selection
The auto-fill feature uses the same profile fields that were selected during poster generation:
- **Full Name**: User's full name
- **Business Name**: Company/business name  
- **Phone Number**: Contact phone number
- **Address**: Business or personal address
- **Website**: Business website URL
- **Social Media**: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn links

### 3. Strategic Text Placement
The system places text in strategic locations to fill white space:

#### Primary Positions:
1. **Top-Left Corner**: Company name or contact info
2. **Top-Right Corner**: Phone number or website
3. **Bottom-Left Corner**: Address or social media
4. **Bottom-Right Corner**: Additional contact details
5. **Top-Center**: Main business information
6. **Bottom-Center**: Secondary contact information

#### Compact Format:
- If more fields exist than positions, remaining fields are combined
- Compact text appears at the bottom with separator bars
- Format: "Field: Value | Field: Value | Field: Value"

### 4. Professional Text Styling
All auto-filled text includes:
- **Background**: Semi-transparent white (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9))
- **Border**: Blue border with rounded corners
- **Font**: Arial, 16px, semi-bold for readability
- **Color**: Dark text (#2c3e50) for maximum contrast
- **Padding**: 10px for comfortable spacing
- **Editable**: All text can be moved, resized, or edited

## How It Works

### 1. Field Detection
