### **Demo Script for Client:**

> **"Let me show you our poster management system. As you can see, users can create beautiful posters using our AI-powered generator. But what's really important is the complete lifecycle management we provide.
> 
> **Delete Functionality Demo:**
> 
> 1. **Individual Delete**: Watch how easy it is to delete a single poster. Just click the delete button, confirm, and it's gone - both from the database and the file system.
> 
> 2. **Bulk Operations**: For power users, we also support bulk deletion. Select multiple posters and delete them all at once.

> 4. **User Experience**: See the loading states and success messages? Everything provides clear feedback to the user.
> 
> This ensures users have complete control over their content while maintaining data integrity and security."

### **Technical Implementation Details:**

#### **Frontend (JavaScript)**
```javascript
function deletePoster(posterId, posterTitle) {
    if (confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete "${posterTitle}"?`)) {
        // Show loading state
        const deleteBtn = event.target.closest('button');
        deleteBtn.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-spinner fa-spin"></i> Deleting...';
        deleteBtn.disabled = true;
        
        // Submit form with CSRF protection
        const form = document.createElement('form');
        form.method = 'POST';
        form.action = `/poster/${posterId}/delete`;
        
        // Add CSRF token
        const csrfToken = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]');
        if (csrfToken) {
            const csrfInput = document.createElement('input');
            csrfInput.type = 'hidden';
            csrfInput.name = 'csrf_token';
            csrfInput.value = csrfToken.getAttribute('content');
            form.appendChild(csrfInput);
        }
        
        document.body.appendChild(form);
        form.submit();
    }
}
```

#### **Backend (Python/Flask)**
```python
@poster_bp.route('/<int:poster_id>/delete', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def delete(poster_id):
    poster = Poster.query.get_or_404(poster_id)
    
    # Check permissions
    if poster.user_id != current_user.id:
        flash('You do not have permission to delete this poster.', 'danger')
        return redirect(url_for('poster.gallery'))
    
    # Delete file and database record
    try:
        # Delete physical file
        file_path = os.path.join('static', 'uploads', 'posters', poster.filename)
        if os.path.exists(file_path):
            os.remove(file_path)
        
        # Delete database record
        db.session.delete(poster)
        db.session.commit()
        
        flash('Poster deleted successfully.', 'success')
    except Exception as e:
        db.session.rollback()
        flash('Error deleting poster.', 'danger')
    
    return redirect(url_for('poster.gallery'))
```
